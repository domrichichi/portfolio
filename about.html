              I'm a graphic designer in Ottawa, Canada
              Branding, Motion Design, and Illustration
            </p>
            <p>
              My background includes deep interests in visual art, which lead me to pursue a degree in art history and theory, where I cultivated my understanding and capacities for the dramatic, the decorative, the innovative and the memorable. 
            </p>
            <p>
              My design work is reflective of my enthusiastic attitude, my passion for helping others, and my love of collaboration. I'm always trying to learn new things and am always looking for inspiration.
