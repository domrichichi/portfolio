            Inspired by early renaissance sculpture, Domonic’s ultra condensed shape gives it a beautiful, yet haunting feel. With this condensed yet ornate form, each glyph can be used as its own single piece of art, or can be used as a powerful centrepiece for any form of print-media digital media.</p>

            <p>As one of  the most obvious features of Domonic, curved 
              finials are what makes the font seem sleek but eerie at the 
              same time. The finials are made throughout the font using 
              the same sized circle which keeps a sense of harmony 
              throughout all of the glyphs.</p>

            <p>Much like tombstones in a graveyard, Domonic’s letterforms have a strong use of figure ground relationship. The glyphs finials and strokes end with sharp slices that conform to the white space around other rounded characters. The letter structures, along with the negative space around them, create a sense of unity and connectedness.</p>
