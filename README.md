Hey! I'm Dom.

I'm a pretty odd dude, with a warm heart.

Multidisplinary designer with an degree in art history and theory.
                                                                                               
My values revolve around always learning, always exploring , and be passionate about what you love.

I apply these very same life experiences to what I put into my design work.
Mostly through experimentation, achieving beauty through depth, and ultimately creating a memorable experience.
