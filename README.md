Hey! I"m Dom

Multidisciplinary Designer

I'm an odd dude with a warm heart, and a need to create.

My journey involves achieving a degree in fine arts, constantly creating, making new friends, and always exploring.

I apply these very same life experiences to everything I put into my design work.

Most of it revolves around experimentation, achieving beauty with depth, and evoking emotion. Whether it be someone passing around a business card I designed, or a reading digital comic book that I illustrated. 

Nothing is better than creating experiences and new stories for other people.
